Today we're excited to share that weâ€™ve released a software prototype of new quantum methods for combinatorial optimization! This project grew out of previous research that introduced a novel approach to encode classical variables more efficiently into quantum states. This translates into a step forward in enabling the exploration of larger problem instances on a quantum computer.

[Try it for yourself](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qiskit-community/prototype-qrao/HEAD?labpath=docs%2Ftutorials%2F01_getting_started.ipynb) without installing any code.
